Although the name change has been approved by the SAGNC, it has not yet been approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture, Pallo Jordan, as of 31 March 2006. The matter is currently under consideration while he has requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer the public response back to the SAGNC, before presenting his recommendation before parliament, who will vote on the change. Various public interest groups have warned that the name change will be challenged in court, should the minister approve the renaming. The long process involved made it unlikely the name would change in 2006, even assuming the Minister had approved the change early in the year 2006."

    "details": "Groningen, provincie (province), northern Netherlands, drained by numerous short rivers and canals, including the Ems (Eems), the Hoen, the Reit, and the Winschoten canals. The province occupies the region between the Wadden Sea and the Ems Estuary (to the north and northeast), the German border (southeast), and the provinces of Drenthe and Friesland (south and west) and includes the Frisian island of Rottumeroog. The capital is the municipality of Groningen.The early history of the province is chiefly one of almost continuous conflict between the town of Groningen and the surrounding districts known as the Ommelanden. Although Groningen acquired a dominant position in the region, the disputes persisted; the Ommelanden subscribed to the Union of Utrecht (1579) and the revolt against Spain, while the town of Groningen remained loyal to the Spanish king."

The oldest existing charter for the town (1441) refers to a still-earlier charter. Århus became a bishopric in 948 and prospered during the European Middle Ages, having many religious institutions at that time, but the city declined after the Reformation. Beginning in the 19th century, industrialization, the extension of the Danish railway system, and the expansion of its harbour stimulated the city’s growth to the point that Århus is now Jutland’s foremost city and the second largest city in Denmark. It is a busy port and is the centre of commerce and industry in Jutland. Århus’ manufactures include metals, chemicals, machinery, beer, and tobacco products, and there are shipbuilding facilities."

A bishop’s seat from the 10th century, it became a centre for religious pilgrimages in the Middle Ages after the canonization of Canute IV, who was murdered before the high altar in St. Alban’s Church in 1086. Odense was burned (1247) during a royal rivalry but recovered to thrive as a commercial centre in the 16th and 17th centuries (it had been chartered in 1335). Growth and trade were stimulated when it became a port with the construction of the harbour and the opening of the Odense Canal (1804). Odense is one of Denmark’s main manufacturing centres; it is home to the Albani brewery (founded in 1859), in addition to modern machinery, electronics, and pharmaceutical plants."
